      <h2>Hi it's me, your favourite SuperHero</h2>
      <p>Superheroes no longer wear capes,
        <br />
        <span class="article-span"> (they do in extreme situations, like if your kitten is stuck up on a branch)
        </span>
        <br />
        they now wear masks and PPE Kits.
        As uncle Ben had rightly said, <span class="uncle-ben">"With great power comes great
          responsibility"</span>
        and it is now our responsibility to take good care of you and your family.

    <p>Yes, you wanna help? Just stay home and ask your family to do the same. Move out only during emergencies and when
